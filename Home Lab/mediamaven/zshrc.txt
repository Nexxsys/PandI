# nmap_open_ports: scan for open ports on target.
# nmap_list_interfaces: list all network interfaces on host where the command runs.
# nmap_slow: slow scan that avoids to spam the targets logs.
# nmap_fin: scan to see if hosts are up with TCP FIN scan.
# nmap_full: aggressive full scan that scans all ports, tries to determine OS and service versions.
# nmap_check_for_firewall: TCP ACK scan to check for firewall existence.
# nmap_ping_through_firewall: host discovery with SYN and ACK probes instead of just pings to avoid firewall restrictions.
# nmap_fast: fast scan of the top 300 popular ports.
# nmap_detect_versions: detects versions of services and OS, runs on all ports.
# nmap_check_for_vulns: uses vulscan script to check target services for vulnerabilities.
# nmap_full_udp: same as full but via UDP.
# nmap_traceroute: try to traceroute using the most common ports.
# nmap_full_with_scripts: same as nmap_full but also runs all the scripts.
# nmap_web_safe_osscan: little "safer" scan for OS version as connecting to only HTTP and HTTPS ports doesn't look so attacking.
# nmap_ping_scan: ICMP scan for active hosts.
