# Homelabs

I have create a number of home labs and used them for various learning projects.  These were original setup using VirtualBox, but I have switched to VMWare Wokstation 17 to manage my VM and labs.

## Labs

### Docker Playground
I have setup a Pop-OS VM running various docker images.  I have been experimenting with the various use cases for docker in my InfoSec learning including the straightfoward examples like bWAPP.  I have also setup some docker images to assit with [Pentesting](https://blog.ropnop.com/docker-for-pentesters/)

### Metasploitable 2
I setup this older VM with pfSense firewall VM to play around with attacking a machine through a firewall like pfSense as well as to be able to drop in other machines on this same network.
